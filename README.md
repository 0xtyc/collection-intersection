# Collection Intersection

A JavaFX desktop application that generates two collections of random numbers based on collection sizes and upper bound from user input, calculates the intersection of the two collections with hashing algorithm, and displays the size of the intersection and the execution time. It intends to compare the execution time when hashing the larger collection vs. the smaller collection.
